# Chrome Extension Frontend

ðŸš§ In very very early development. ðŸš§

Chrome devtools extension for debugging Solid applications.
It allows for visualizing and interacting with Solid's reactivity graph, as well as inspecting component state and hierarchy.

## How do I try it out?

I've submitted the extension to the Chrome Web Store, but it's pending approval, so you'll have to wait until you can just install it from the Chrome Web Store.

To try it out currently, you'll have to clone this repo and build the extension yourself.
