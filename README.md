# Solid Devtools

Reactivity Debugger & Devtools Chrome Extension for SolidJS.

## Why?

To change the way you write, debug and understand your SolidJS applications and reactivity within.

## Available Devtools

All of the packages are currently nothing more then just ideas. Some in progress, and some very much in progress. But a man can dream, and this is what's out there waiting:

### [Babel Plugin](./packages/babel-plugin/)

###### `@solid-devtools/babel-plugin`

A babel plugin for vite for transforming Solid code. For development â€” debugging purposes only.

Currently only transforms JSX, adding code location to it. Necessary for the [Locator](./packages/locator/) package.

### [Debugger](./packages/debugger/)

###### `solid-devtools`

A runtime package, used to get information out of the Solid's reactivity graph. It's a cornerstone of almost all packages.

It comes with [Extension Adapter](./packages/extension-adapter/) and [Locator](./packages/locator/) packages included.

### [Chrome Extension](./packages/extension/)

Not-yet-public Chrome extension for visualizing and interacting with Solid's reactivity graph.

### [Extension Adapter](./packages/extension-adapter/)

###### `@solid-devtools/extension-adapter`

A runtime library connecting the [Debugger](./packages/debugger/) with [Chrome Extension](./packages/extension/).

### [Locator](./packages/locator/)

###### `@solid-devtools/locator`

A runtime library for locating components on the page, and their source code in VSCode.

### [UI](./packages/ui/)

###### `@solid-devtools/ui`

A collection of UI components for visualizing and interacting with Solid's reactivity graph. Used by the [Chrome Extension](./packages/extension/).
